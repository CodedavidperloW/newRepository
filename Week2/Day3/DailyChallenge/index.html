    <h1>Design a Code for the Pattern</h1>
    <p>I need to make a pattern of a row of stars, from one to six<br>
        So the following steps I will take:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Make an array string with the pattern</li>
        <!--<li>Or maybe a formula that adds one star consecutively</li>--->
        <li>Make a For of Loop</li>
        <li>Add an if....else statement which goes to the next element in the string.</li>
        <li>console.log each statement</li>
    </ol>
<!--- I know that there must be a more efficient way, a way that would add the star automatically through
a formula, but not sure how. -->
